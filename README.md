Explanation on how to compile and run my program.

Install Scala: (https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and follow the installation instructions.

Compile the Scala program: Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Scala file is located. Use the sbt command to compile.

Run the Scala program: Once the Scala program is compiled, you can execute it using the ~run command followed by the name of the input and output files names. 

For example: ~run location.json regions.json results.json

The program will then execute, and you should see the output or any errors printed to the terminal.
